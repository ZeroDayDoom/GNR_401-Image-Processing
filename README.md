## Project summary

This repository contains an implementation of fundamental image processing and enhancement algorithms applied to a hyperspectral image cube (Indian Pines). All core image-processing algorithms were implemented from scratch (no library functions used for the core transforms), as required by the project brief.

Implemented algorithms:
- Log transform
- Gamma correction
- Contrast stretching
- Histogram equalization
- Convolution filters:
  - Mean (average) filter
  - Gradient filters (edge detection)
